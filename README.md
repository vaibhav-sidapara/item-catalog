##### System Requirements
This project makes use of Linux-based virtual machine (VM).
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

##### System Setup 
1. Git Clone  [fullstack-nanodegree-vm](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)
    * Further Instructions provided on the above Udacity's repo on how to run the vagrant box.
    * Python & SQLite are already installed and started in the VM 
2. Git Clone this repo in your local directory such that it can be accessed from the vagrant machine via ssh
3. This app uses Google's OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization.
    * Create an app project in the Google APIs Console â€” https://console.developers.google.com/apis
    * Create an OAuth Client ID.
    * When you're presented with a list of application types, choose Web application.
    * You can then set the **Authorized Javascript Origins** & **Authorised redirect URIs**

            - *Authorized Javascript Origins* : http://localhost:8000
            - *Authorised redirect URIs* : http://localhost:8000/google_login
    * You will then be able to get the client ID and client secret.
    * Replace the client_secrets.json with your client secret and also replace the client_id value in login.js.
